# **Hades II Custom Chaos Trial Generator**

Web tool for generating chaos trial loadouts for Hades II, with full customization over the different aspects of the trial.

To run it, you just need to open index.html in a web browser. The browser will remember your latest used settings whenever you save, load, or generate a trial from a setting.

## **Features**

### **Fear Customization**

You can set the fear of the trial, and set a minimum and maximum amount of times a vow can be selected.

###  **Arcana Customization**

You can force certain cards to appear, randomize them, or fully disable them from selection. 

### **Keepsake Customization**

You can select which keepsakes are eligible to show up for each region. The results will hide the keepsake until you reach that biome and open the spoiler.

### **Aspect and Familiar Customization**

You can select which aspects and familiars are eligible to be selected.

###  **Death Defiance and Strength Logic**

Options for removing Death Defiance and Strength anti-synergies. You can disable ways to obtain Death Defiance if Strength is selected, and make sure strength is not selected if you already got death defiance.

## **Persistence**

The latest settings you saved, loaded, or used for a trial will be saved for when you use the website again. If you run a certain seed with specific settings, you will get the same trial. You can also export your settings to a JSON file to keep them as backups.
